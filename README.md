# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Lincoln  

I‚Äôm a **Frontend Developer** who truly enjoys bringing ideas to life through code.  
My favorite part of the job is taking a design or concept and turning it into something people can actually use and interact with.  

I‚Äôve graduated in **Software Engineering** and also completed a **postgraduate in UX Engineering**, because I wanted to understand not just *how* to build software, but also *why* people use it the way they do. My curiosity doesn‚Äôt stop there ‚Äî one of my future goals is to pursue a **master‚Äôs degree in Human-Computer Interaction** (HCI) or a related field, so I can go deeper into how people and technology connect.

## ‚ú® What I enjoy working with  

- **Frontend development**: React, Next.js, Vue, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS  
- **Styling**: Sass, Less, TailwindCSS  
- **CMS**: Plone 5 & 6 (Volto)  
- **Design & UX**: Figma, UX Engineering practices, accessibility (a11y), usability principles  
- **Other tools**: Node.js, Git, Python basics  
- **What excites me most**: clean, accessible, and user-friendly web experiences

## üí° Why I care about UX  

I started diving into design because I wanted to better understand how designers think ‚Äî and how I could make their ideas real through code. Along the way, I discovered how much **accessibility, usability, and design thinking** matter for creating meaningful digital products.

## üå± Ongoing journey  

I‚Äôm always learning something new. Sometimes it‚Äôs a framework, sometimes a design tool, sometimes just a better way to structure code. My goal is to keep growing, stay curious, and contribute to projects that make a difference for people.
